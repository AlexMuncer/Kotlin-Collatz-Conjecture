# Kotlin-Collatz-conjecture

This is the Kotlin representation of the unsolved mathematical problem that is the collatz conjecture.

Unsolved problem in mathematics: Does the Collatz sequence eventually reach 1 for all positive integer initial values? The Collatz conjecture in mathematics asks whether repeating two simple arithmetic operations will eventually transform every positive integer into one.
